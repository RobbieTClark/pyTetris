Tetris board size = 10 wide x 20 high
Arrow key functions:
	Down arrow key = fast drop
	Left arrow key = move one block left
	Right arrow key = move one block right
Need to display next piece before it falls

Make a dialog box to pop up after tetris game finishes (or just have a box asking to start again?)
